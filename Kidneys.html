    <h1>Kidneys</h1>

    <p>The Kidneys are my favorite organs in the body, you truly don't realize how important these little guys
        are. As a person who had dealt with kidney failure and got a kidney transplant my experience without 
        a kidneys was interesting atleast. My story about kidney failure started back in March of 2020, when I 
        got my blood tested at my primary care, then at St. Joes, and finally at U of M Ann Arbor. The symptoms of
        Kidney failure happened out of nowhere and started appearing in the summer of 2019, where I had no energy, 
        had roughly meal size worth of food through out the week, and I was anemic. I wen through a series of ups and downs
        going from hemodialysis to peritoneal dialysis(which is better for the kidneys) back to hemodialysis and then
        back to peritoneal but eventually May of 2022 I got a Kidney transplant and now living a normal life.

<h2>About Kidneys</h2>

<p>The Kidneys are two bean-shaped organs roughly the size of a fist. They are located deep to
to the ribcage and lateral to the spine. Healthy kidneys filter roughly a half cup of blood every minute
and is important because it filters out toxins and waste in the body and excrete it out of the 
body through urine. Urine flows out of the kidneys through thin tubes called the ureters to
the bladder and eventually to the urethra where it is expelled from the body.Neat fact about myself, 
my only kidney when I was diagnosed with kidney failure was the size of a small chicken nugget barely hanging on. 
</p>

<h2>Importance of Kidneys</h2>

<p>Kidneys are very important to the body for many reason:</p>
<ul> 
    <li>Remove waste and extra fluids from the body.</li>
    <li>Play an active role in PH balance in the body, by maintaining a healthy water balance
        of salts, fluids, and minerals. </li>
    <li>Kidneys also help in controlling blood pressure.</li>
    <li>Help produce blood cells.</li>
    <li>Help maintain healthy bones.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Kidney Failure</h2>

<p>What is kidney failure? Kidney failure occurs when a kidney undergoing kidney disease
    of some sort reaches below 15 percent functionality. Due to the loss in functionality your
    body can lead to symptoms like build up of waste, or become anemic. The National Institute of
    Diabetes, Digestive, and Kidney Diseases recommends that the earliest you detect symptoms
    makes you better off in treatment and safety. The following treatments are beneficial 
    for kidney failure patients:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Hemodialysis which is a type of dialysis, that filters the blood through a machine.
        Patients would typically go to a clinic to get this done three times a week but there are 
        scenarios where these patients can have it done every night when they sleep with their own machine 
    </li>
    <li>Peritoneal Dialysis is another type of dialysis which is healthier to the kidneys health
        than hemodialysis. This type of dialysis is done from a catheter placed in your abdomen
        in from of the pertitoneum membrane. Fluid is then cirulated through the catheter and body 
        to filter waste out of the abdomen.
    </li>
    <li>Major lifestyle changes like, change of diet and exercising to maintain both
        healthy kidneys and heart because the two are linked for a healthy body.
    </li>
    <li>Finally, receiving a kidney transplant is the ultimate way to stop kidney failure because,
        you now have a functioning kidney but with the added cost of immunosuppressants to prevent 
        the body from detecting the kidney as a foreign invader.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Risk Factors</h2>

<p>There is a small but important list of risk factors that can lead to CKD(Chronic Kidney Disease)
    and eventually kidney failure:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Diabetes is one of the most common causes of CKD</li>
<li>High blood-pressure is another common cause of CKD</li>
<li>Heart disease</li>
<li>Obesity</li>
<li>Family history of CKD</li>
<li>Inherited kidney diseases</li>
<li>Past kidney damages</li>
<li>Older age</li>
</ul>
